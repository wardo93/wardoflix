# Access Control

You can control who runs WardoFlix from a single file in this repo: `access.json`. Every launch of the app fetches this file from GitHub raw. If the client's install ID isn't allowed, the app refuses to open.

## The moving parts

- **`access.json`** — at the repo root. Commit changes to `main`, push, done.
- **Each install has a unique ID** — a UUID generated on first launch, stored in `%APPDATA%/WardoFlix/install-id.txt` (Windows) or the equivalent userData dir on macOS/Linux. Visible to the user in the debug overlay (Ctrl+Shift+D, bottom).
- **Client fetches `access.json` on every launch** from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wardo93/wardoflix/main/access.json`. No auth needed (public file).
- **If GitHub is unreachable**, the client uses a cached copy up to 7 days old, then fails closed.
- **Dev builds bypass the check** (`isDev` in `electron/main.js`). Production/packaged builds enforce it.

## Per-install overrides (label / pinpoint specific users)

`access.json` has an `install_overrides` block keyed on install ID. The dashboard fetches this file on every refresh and applies these on top of the live data. Use it to label and precisely locate friends without making them touch any files.

```json
"install_overrides": {
  "4ec68254-ef28-43ec-869f-90387dd3a00b": {
    "friendlyName": "Ward (Moerkerke)",
    "lat": 51.2486,
    "lon": 3.3373
  },
  "<some-other-uuid>": {
    "friendlyName": "Alex"
  }
}
```

- All fields optional. Omit `lat`/`lon` to keep using whatever the client reports (GPS / IP / manual).
- Override coords always win — they outrank `manual-coords.txt`, GPS, and IP geo. The popup will show "Owner override".
- `friendlyName` here outranks `userData/friendly-name.txt` and the OS username, so you control what appears in the sidebar regardless of what the client provides.
- Push to main → dashboard refresh shows the changes within ~60s (it caches the access.json fetch for a minute).

## Collecting existing users' IDs first (the bootstrap)

Before you flip `mode` to `allowlist`, you need every legitimate user's install ID, otherwise you'll lock them out. The soft rollout:

1. Ship a build with `access.json` set to `mode: "open"` — no-one is blocked. This ships v1.5.1.
2. Have each friend relaunch (auto-updater will download 1.5.1), then open Ctrl+Shift+D, hit **Copy install ID**, send it to you.
3. Collect all IDs into `access.json` → `allow[]`.
4. Commit + push. (No new build needed — the running client will re-fetch on next launch.)
5. Flip `mode` to `"allowlist"`. Commit + push.

From that point forward, only IDs in `allow[]` can launch the app. Everyone else gets the access-denied screen with their ID displayed for them to send to you.

## Daily operations

### Add a new user

1. Ask them for their install ID (Ctrl+Shift+D → Copy install ID)
2. Edit `access.json`, add the ID to `allow[]`
3. `git commit -am "access: allowlist <name>" && git push`
4. Their next launch (or the next time their cache refreshes) grants access

### Revoke a user

Two options depending on urgency:

**Fast (takes effect within 7 days even if they lose internet):** add their ID to `blocked[]`. This trumps `allow[]` and applies in every mode.

**Clean (takes effect next live fetch):** remove their ID from `allow[]` under `mode: "allowlist"`.

In both cases: `git commit -am "access: revoke <name>" && git push`. Their next launch blocks them.

Note: the cache window means a revoked user with no internet can keep launching for up to 7 days after revocation. Shortening that requires a separate online check each launch (currently we only fall back to cache if the live fetch fails).

### Kill everyone at once

Set `mode: "allowlist"` and empty `allow[]`. Everyone including you gets blocked. Reverse by adding your own ID back.

### See who's actually launching the app

`access.json` has an optional `telemetry` block. If you set a URL, every launch POSTs `{installId, version, platform, ts}` to it. Options:

1. **Discord webhook** — fastest, free. Create a webhook in a private Discord channel (Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy URL), then:
   ```json
   "telemetry": {
     "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/AAA/BBB",
     "format": "discord"
   }
   ```
   Every launch posts `launch <uuid> v1.5.1 (win32-x64)` as a message. You scroll the channel to see who launched when.

2. **Cloudflare Worker** (recommended if you want a dashboard) — free tier, 100k requests/day. A minimal worker that writes to KV and serves a counter page is ~30 lines. Not wired up here; let me know if you want me to scaffold it.

3. **Leave it disabled** — that's the current default (`"disabled": true`).

## Security notes

- The allowlist file is **public**. Anyone can see which IDs are allowed. That's fine — knowing an allowed ID doesn't help them get access because they can't put it in their local install (the client generates its own).
- **The client-side check can be bypassed** by someone willing to unpack the ASAR, patch the JS, and repack. Realistically: your close-friends-of-friends group won't do this. If it becomes a real concern, the hardening path is a remote server that gates Torrentio lookups — big architecture change, not currently in scope.
- The install ID is just a random UUID — no personal info. Knowing it tells you nothing about the user besides "this specific installation."

## Quick reference

```
Path                       Contents
%APPDATA%/WardoFlix/
  install-id.txt           Client's UUID (one line)
  access-cache.json        Last-good fetch of access.json + timestamp
  wardoflix.log            Includes [access] lines for debugging
```

Repo file → commit → every launch of every client fetches it → done.
